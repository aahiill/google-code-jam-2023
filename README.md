# My Google Code Jam 2023 Submission: Top 25 in the UK
My (successful) code for Google Code Jam 2023 challenges

Did 2 of the challenges, scoring full points in the first problem (Colliding Encoding)

While my program solved the other problem (ASCII Art), I missed out on extra points because my program took 40 seconds instead of 20 seconds to test numbers from 1 to 10^12...

In the end I placed top 25 in the UK which was pretty cool for my first ever coding competition :)
